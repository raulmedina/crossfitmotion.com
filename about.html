		<p>At <strong>CrossFit Motion</strong>, we offer world-class innovative Fitness programming led by our team of top Certified CrossFit trainers. Elevate your performance and make Fitness your lifestyle today!</p>

 

        <p>CrossFit Motion is the newest state of the art Fitness and Training Center in Miami! Located just minutes from Miami Beach, Brickell, and only a few blocks away from Downtown Miami's business district.
        The facility features 8,000 sq feet of training space, dressing rooms, private showers, and plenty of gated private parking free of charge.</p>
        
        <p>CrossFit Motion is a strength and conditioning program managed by Tony Danza, certified trainer and one of the pioneers of CrossFit in South Florida. His team consists of some of the top CrossFit trainers
        in the industry. The CrossFit Downtown Miami program is designed for universal scalability, making it the perfect application for any committed individual regardless of experience. CrossFit taps into all 3 metabolic
        pathways, where as other forms of physical activity only tap into one or two. The workouts are short duration but at high intensity. CrossFit takes you out of the routine and out of your comfort zone, getting into 
        a routine is the enemy!</p>
        
        <p>CrossFit Motion features a daily WOD (workout of the day) for all of our classes. The clients come in and as a group, we go through our warm ups, explain and demonstrate the WODâ€¦ Then its 3, 2, 1 GO!!!</p>
        
        <p>CrossFit workouts are different every day. The workouts are programed for the week and balanced out to perfection. On an average, there can be from 1 to 10 exercises in a WOD and you might not see the same routine
         for 2 to 3 months. The workouts are in group settings with a (1) trainer to every 5 client ratio. Our trainers are there for instruction, technique, motivation, and inspiration.</p>
        
        <p>The unique thing about CrossFit is that you do not have to be there for hours training. The workouts could be as quick as minutes, depending on your fitness level, progress, and the given workout for that day.
         The average workout typically lasts up to 45 minutes. The sport of CrossFit and the competition motivates you to go harder. The camaraderie with the other clients is amazing. You build a strong bond with the people 
         that go through the same struggles as you are.</p>
        
        <p>Are you tired of the traditional boring gym routine? CrossFit Motion will change the mentality very soon!</p>
