         <h2>Family Games</h2>
            
	     <p>CrossFit has become the epitome of the "sport of fitness."   A CrossFit competition occurs locally every month, and often every weekend.  Most of these competitions offer athletes a chance to compete against their
         peers as individuals or teams.  They usually feature several CrossFit style workouts mixed in with various single modality exercises (a run, a lift, a gymnastic movement).  Many CrossFit competitions now offer substantial
          prizes for the winners including cash payments..</p>

         <h2>State Events</h2>
         
         <p>The CrossFit Games is the Superbowl of fitness.  Many athletes have committed themselves entirely to this sport and to earning a spot in the Games as an individual or as part of a team.  Since the sponsorship of Reebok
         in 2011 which brought a $1,000,000 purse to the Games, the Interest in the sport of CrossFit is growing exponentially, from 70 total competitors in the CrossFit Games in 2007 to more than 60,000 participants in the CrossFit
         Games Open in 2012.</p>

         <h2>Professional Competition</h2>
         
         <p>Preparation for CrossFit competitions, especially the CrossFit Open, the   Regionals and the CrossFit Games requires disciplined workout   programming that covers a broad range of fitness and skills with an   emphasis on
         strength training and attacking weaknesses. Â Programming   follows a strength / metcon bias calendar designed to qualify athletes   for the Regionals and prepare them for the eventual load during the   Regionals and the Games.</p>
